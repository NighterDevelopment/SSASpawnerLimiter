# SSA Spawner Limiter Configuration
# Language file to use (currently only en_US is supported)
language: "en_US"

# Enable or disable debug mode (prints extra info to console)
debug: false

# ========== CHUNK LIMIT SETTINGS ==========
# Enable or disable chunk-based spawner limit
enable_chunk_limit: true

# Maximum number of spawners (including stacks) allowed per chunk
# Each stack in a spawner counts toward the limit (not just 1 per spawner block)
# Example: 1 spawner block with 64 stack + 1 spawner block with 6 stack = 70 total count in chunk
max_spawners_per_chunk: 1000

# Verify actual spawner count in chunk before checking limits
# When enabled, the plugin will count all spawner stacks in the chunk using SmartSpawner API
# This is useful for servers that already had spawners before installing this addon
# Recommended: Keep enabled until all chunks have correct counts, then disable to save performance
verify_chunk_count_on_check: true

# ========== PLAYER LIMIT SETTINGS ==========
# Enable or disable per-player spawner limit
enable_player_limit: true

# Default maximum number of spawners (including stacks) a player can place globally
# This is the base limit for all players
# Players can get higher limits through permissions using pattern: ssaspawnerlimiter.perplayer.<number>
#   Examples:
#   - ssaspawnerlimiter.perplayer.1500 = allows 1500 spawners
#   - ssaspawnerlimiter.perplayer.2000 = allows 2000 spawners
#   - ssaspawnerlimiter.perplayer.10000 = allows 10000 spawners (any number works!)
#   - ssaspawnerlimiter.perplayer.bypass = unlimited spawners
# If player has multiple permission nodes, the highest value will be used
max_spawners_per_player: 500
