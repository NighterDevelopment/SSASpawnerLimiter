# Enable or disable debug mode (prints extra info to console)
debug: false

# Maximum number of spawners (including stacks) allowed per chunk
# Each stack in a spawner counts toward the limit (not just 1 per spawner block)
# Example: 1 spawner block with 64 stack + 1 spawner block with 6 stack = 70 total count in chunk
max_spawners_per_chunk: 100

# Verify actual spawner count in chunk before checking limits
# When enabled, the plugin will count all spawner stacks in the chunk using SmartSpawner API
# This is useful for servers that already had spawners before installing this addon
# Recommended: Keep enabled until all chunks have correct counts, then disable to save performance
